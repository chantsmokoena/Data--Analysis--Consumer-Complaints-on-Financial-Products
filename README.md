2022: 282 complaints (highest)
ðŸ“Š Insights:
âœ” Complaints increased significantly in 2022, which may indicate rising consumer dissatisfaction, policy changes, or financial difficulties.

2. Complaints by Product
A pie chart categorizes total complaints by product:

Checking/Savings Accounts received the most complaints (633 cases).
Credit Cards & Prepaid Cards followed with 440 cases.
Mortgages accounted for 165 cases.
Other product categories (Debt Collection, Credit Reporting, Student Loans, etc.) had fewer complaints.
ðŸ“Š Insights:
âœ” Checking/Savings accounts and Credit Cards have the highest number of complaints, suggesting potential issues with account management, fees, or fraudulent transactions.

3. Complaint Resolution Analysis
A KPI card highlights 958 complaints closed with an explanation, while others resulted in monetary or non-monetary relief.

ðŸ“Š Insights:

# Business Impact & Insights
âœ” Reducing Complaints & Improving Customer Support

Prioritizing high-complaint products (e.g., Checking/Savings Accounts, Credit Cards) for process improvements can enhance service quality.
Identifying common consumer concerns can help develop targeted FAQs, better training for customer service teams, and policy adjustments.
âœ” Enhancing Complaint Resolution Efficiency

Analyzing submission channels allows financial institutions to allocate support resources effectively, ensuring faster response times.
If a significant number of complaints require monetary relief, proactive measures (such as clearer disclosures on fees and policies) can help reduce future issues.

The increase in complaints from 2018 to 2022 suggests the need for ongoing tracking and trend analysis.
Future enhancements could include sentiment analysis of complaint descriptions to identify recurring themes and improve consumer relations.
